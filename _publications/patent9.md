The invention discloses an active clamping circuit, and belongs to the field of integrated circuit design and solves problems that in the prior art, a clamping circuit is large in power consumption, unstable in performance, long in response time, delayed in work and the like. The active clamping circuit comprises an input stage which is composed of two reference voltage sources and is used for providing a reference voltage for an operational amplifier, the operational amplifier which is used for responding to the reference voltage transmitted by the input stage, and an output stage which is used for adjusting an output voltage of the operational amplifier and outputting the clamping voltage. The active clamping circuit is advantaged in that a Zener diode in a traditional scheme is replaced, so a quick-response clamping function is realized, and the power consumption is relatively low when the Zener diode does not work; through the response of the open-loop active clamping circuit to different voltages, a stable clamping voltage is outputted, and the normal operation of a subsequent circuit is ensured; oscillation of the system can be reduced, power consumption of the system is reduced, and stability of the chip during working is improved.
