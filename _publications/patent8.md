The invention discloses an LED driving method, an LED driving circuit and a display screen, and belongs to the technical field of LED driving chips. In order to solve the problem of poor display effect caused by dark first row and serious high-low contrast coupling of an LED in a scanning period in the prior art, the invention provides an LED driving method, which comprises the following steps of: in a row signal display period of each LED display array, guiding a passing signal; and then selecting a first row compensation function or an anti-coupling function by judging the display gray scale of the row signal, conducting column conduction to display data after the first row compensation function or the anti-coupling function is realized, turning off a column signal to eliminate shadow after the display is finished, and turning off the row signal after the shadow elimination is finished. The problems of unclear or fuzzy picture display, poor display effect and the like are solved, the response speed is high, the display effect of the LED display screen is improved, the display quality of the LED display screen is ensured, and the method is simple to operate and suitable for wide application.
