The invention provides a clock duty ratio trimming method and system, and the method specifically comprises the steps: carrying out the time delay control of a to-be-trimmed input signal, and carrying out the current control and time control; according to the input signal after current control and time control processing, charging and discharging adjustment is carried out on the charge pump; and after shaping, outputting a trimmed sine wave signal. In order to solve the problems that the duty ratio of a clock signal actually existing in a circuit is unstable, and a traditional duty ratio adjusting circuit is large in power consumption and unstable in performance, calibration of the duty ratio of the input clock signal is achieved by converting the clock signal and conducting delay control, and the purpose that the duty ratio is not affected by temperature, voltage and the manufacturing process is achieved. And on the other hand, after the first period is unrelated to the input signal, so that the accuracy and reliability of the clock signal are improved, Meanwhile, the method has relatively high compatibility and practicability.
