The invention discloses an LED display screen row driving chip driving method and a chip, and belongs to the technical field of LED display screen row driving. Aiming at the problems that in the priorart, the shadow elimination voltage class of an LED display screen row driving chip is not adjustable, the surge phenomenon leads to reverse breakdown of the LED lamp tube, and the LED display panelis easy to damage when working abnormally at a continuous high level,the invention provides an LED display screen row driving chip driving method and a chip. A reverse voltage prevention unit is addedto prevent voltage abnormality caused by surge during working, the working state of the chip is recovered after hot plug through a timing automatic turn-off unit, the configuration of the shadow elimination level of the chip is realized through the change of the number of current enable signals, and the shadow elimination level of the LED is adjustable. According to the invention, the protectioncapability of the chip on the LED lamp tube is improved, the stability of the LED display system is enhanced, the LED display screen row driving chip driving method and the chip can be suitable for different environments and occasions, and when the LED display system is matched with different column chips to work, the LED display screen row driving chip driving method and the chip have stronger adaptability and compatibility.
