The invention discloses an LED driving current modulation method and system and application, belonging to the technical field of LED driving chip design. In order to solve the problems that a digital-analog hybrid gray level adjusting method cannot continue to improve a gray level under the condition that an area is kept unchanged, richer colors cannot be provided in use, and low-gray-level adjusting performance is poor in the prior art, the invention provides the method. The method comprises the following steps: dividing a display signal into a high-order signal and a low-order signal; and dividing reference current according to the bit width of the high-order signal, counting current, setting clock frequency according to the bit width of the low-order signal, and counting current. According to the invention the purpose of increasing gray levels under the condition that a chip area is not changed can be achieved, meanwhile, the low-gray-level display effect is improved through a current division method, and a better display effect under a low gray level can be ensured.
