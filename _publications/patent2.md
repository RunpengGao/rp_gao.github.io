The invention discloses a Mini-LED backlight driving control chip and system supporting breakpoint resume, and belongs to the technical field of Mini-LED driving chip design. In order to solve the problems that in the prior art, a Mini-LED driving chip cannot achieve brightness adjustment and is poor in display effect, the Mini-LED backlight driving control chip and system supporting breakpoint resume are provided, a data recognition unit is arranged to recognize and judge whether a Mini-LED lamp tube is abnormal or not, if the lamp tube, a data input signal is normally received to achieve lamp tube driving, and if the lamp tube is abnormal, a breakpoint is received and an input signal is transmitted continuously to drive the lamp tube; and the breakpoint resuming function is added, the output refresh rate can be controlled through the design of the chip, and the performance of the whole chip is improved.
