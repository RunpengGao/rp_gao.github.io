I have got my master degree in Electronic Engineering from Nanjing University. I have designed several analog integrated circuits, for Bandgap\LDO\Driver etc., building the tools of [Cadence virtuoso](https://rppgao.github.io), Mentor Calibre, which are efficient tools for circuits and layout design. I am also familiar with Synopsys Verilog, thus I am able to do some digital VLSI circuits.

My research area is LED Drivers with a variety of features for both outdoor and indoor LED displays. My master project is ["Research and development of CMOS Micro-LED driver chip"](https://rppgao.github.io)(National key research and development plan project) in which I proposed a framework about high performance LED driver which yields satisfactory performances. [More than 10 Chinese National Invention Patents and one American Patents](https://rppgao.github.io) (LED DISPLAY DRIVER CHIP AND USE THEREOF), and I am now working for an IEEE paper in October (Current Control LED Driver Based On DS-PWM Algorithm). Outstanding academic records are also obtained in my studies, ranking [top 5%](https://rppgao.github.io) out of 300 students and won many academic awards.
