The invention discloses a shadow elimination voltage level control method, a display method, a system and a display device, and belongs to the technical field of LED row driving chips. The invention provides a shadow elimination voltage level control method for solving the problems that in the prior art, the shadow elimination effect in LED display through preset voltage is poor, shadow elimination cannot be effectively achieved or the shadow elimination effect is not obvious, the shadow elimination voltage level cannot be adjusted according to the actual situation, and chip expansibility is insufficient. By arranging the external control card, the shadow elimination voltage level is set, shadow elimination operation is carried out during frame switching, display signals are better protected from ghosting, meanwhile, the external control mode is convenient to register and modify, and the flexibility is very high.
