The invention discloses a Mini-LED driving method and a display system, and belongs to the technical field of Mini-LED driving methods. In order to solve the problems that in the prior art, a Mini-LED backlight area is insufficient, the display effect is poor, the system stability is low, and the service life is short, drive chips are partitioned, and each drive chip corresponds to X columns of different partitions; each partition is driven to work according to an output signal of the driving chip, so that the brightness of each partition is controlled; during driving, output signals of the driving chip comprise a main signal and an auxiliary signal, the main signal is used for signal display when a system is normal, and the auxiliary signal is used for signal display when breakpoints occur in the system and breakpoint resuming is achieved. According to the invention, breakpoint resume is supported, the requirement on the PCB is low, and the overall stability and the display effect of the system are enhanced under the condition that the cost is reduced.
