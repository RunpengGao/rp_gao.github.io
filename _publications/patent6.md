The invention discloses a clock duty ratio calibration method and system, and belongs to the technical field of integrated circuit design. The invention provides a clock duty ratio calibration method and system, and aims to solve the problems that the duty ratio of a clock signal actually existing in a circuit is unstable, and a traditional duty ratio adjusting circuit is large in power consumption, unstable in performance and the like. The invention provides the clock duty ratio calibration method and system, and a signal processing module preprocesses an input clock signal, and a delay generation control module compensates the preprocessed clock signal and calibrates the duty ratio of the clock signal; a delay generation control module outputs a clock signal and converts the clock signal into a square wave through the voltage shaping module, and a \buffer delays the square wave output by the voltage shaping module and outputs the clock signal after duty cycle calibration. The clock signal is converted and subjected to delay control, the duty ratio of the input clock signal is calibrated, the calibration is not influenced by temperature, voltage and manufacturing process, the cost is low, the reliability is high, and the practicability is high.
