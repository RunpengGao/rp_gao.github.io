The invention discloses a driving method and device of a display element, and belongs to the technical field of LED driving chips. In order to solve the problems that in the prior art, when driving current is generated, the bit width is large, the required chip area is large, the bit width is small, and the display effect is poor, the invention provides a driving method and device of a display element, the bit width is divided into a high bit width part and a low bit width part, the high bit width is controlled in an analog mode, the low bit width is controlled in a digital mode, the weight of the output gray level current is increased, the digital control mode prevents the area of a chip from being increased when the gray level is improved, the upper limit of the current gray level is remarkably improved, meanwhile, the low-gray condition is refined, and under the condition that the area of the chip is not affected, the precision and range of gray level current are improved.
