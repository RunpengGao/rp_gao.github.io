collection: publications
permalink: /publication/paper1
excerpt: 'In this study, we try to give a new algorithm for detect hearing Loss patients using magnetic resonance images. It already has several solutions, but they are not suitable for practice. We use Wavelet Entropy (WE) and Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) in proposed algorithm. In the final, we prove our algorithm in 5-fold Cross Validation. The overall accuracy of our method achieved 84.50Â± 0.81%.'
